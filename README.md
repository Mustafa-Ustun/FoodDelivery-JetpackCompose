Food Delivery App

A simple Jetpack Compose tutorial project that demonstrates modern Android UI development.
Built with Kotlin, it showcases Compose layouts, navigation, and state management through a clean and minimal food delivery UI.

This project was created as part of my first hands-on learning with Jetpack Compose.
